    <h1>RESOURCES</h1>
    <h3>The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:
      <ul>
        <li>The University (and associated) Libraries: <a href="http://library.newschool.edu" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">http://library.newschool.edu</a></li>
        <li>University Learning Center: <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center</a></li>

          <br><br>
          In keeping with the university’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.

    <h1>MAKING CENTER</h1>
    <h3>
      The Making Center is a constellation of shops, labs, and open workspaces that are situated across the New School to help students express their ideas in a variety of materials and methods.  We have resources to help support woodworking, metalworking, ceramics and pottery work, photography and film, textiles, printmaking, 3D printing, manual and CNC machining, and more. A staff of technicians and student workers provide expertise and maintain the different shops and labs.  Safety is a primary concern, so each area has policies for access, training, and etiquette with which students and faculty should be familiar.  Many areas require specific orientations or trainings before access is granted.  Detailed information about the resources available, as well as schedules, trainings, and policies can be found at resources.parsons.edu.

    <h2>Grade of W</h2>
    <h3>The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript.</h3>

    <h2>Grade of Z</h2>
    <h3>This grade is to be assigned to students who have <strong>never attended or stopped attending</strong> classes.  Exceptions can be made if the student has completed enough work to warrant a grade (including a failing grade), and arrangements have been made with the instructor(s) and the Dean’s Office prior to grade submission.  The Z grade does not calculate into the student’s GPA.</h3>

    <h2>Grades of Incomplete</h2>
    <h3>
      The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by the student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations:
    </h3>
    <h3 style="margin-left:30px;">
      Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “F” by the Registrar’s Office.
    </h3>

    <h1>COLLEGE, SCHOOL, PROGRAM AND CLASS POLICIES</h1>

    <h3>A comprehensive overview of policy may be found under Policies: A to Z. Students are also encouraged to consult the Academic Catalog for Parsons.</h3>

    <h2>Canvas</h2>
    <h3>Use of Canvas may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week.</h3>

    <h2>Electronic Devices</h2>
    <h3>The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course's work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.</h3>





    <h2>Responsibility</h2>
    <h3>Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.</h3>



    <h2>Active Participation and Attendance</h2>
    <h3>Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.</h3>
    <h3>Parsons’ attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students’ success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus.</h3>
    <h3>While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.</h3>
    <h3>I will assess each student’s performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining your final grade.</h3>

    <h2>Academic Honesty and Integrity</h2>
    <h3>Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.</h3>
    <h3>Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found on the university website under Policies: A to Z. Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the Learning Center’s website.</h3>
    <h3>The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.</h3>

    <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <h3>The New School (the "university") seeks to encourage creativity and invention among its faculty members and students. In doing so, the University affirms its traditional commitment to the personal ownership by its faculty members and students of Intellectual Property Rights in works they create. The complete policy governing Intellectual Property Rights may be seen on the university website, on the Provost’s page.

    <h1>DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC POLICIES</h1>

    <h2>Communication Design Zero Tolerance Attendance Policy</h2>
    <h3>
      In order to foster a studio learning environment where we all learn from peers and through dialogue, timely and regular attendance is a strict expectation for all Communication Design students. Students who are not present in class are unable to meet the learning outcomes of a Communication Design course.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      For classes meeting once a week, students are allowed 2 absences. For classes meeting twice a week, students are allowed 4 absences. Any absence beyond the allowed absences will result in an automatic failure (F) for the course. There are no excused absences. This applies to each and every student.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      A student is deemed tardy if a student fails to arrive within 15 minutes past the beginning of class. 2 tardies will result in an automatic absence. A student who arrives an hour past the beginning of class will be deemed absent.
    </h3>

    <h2>No Late Work and Missed Critiques</h2>
    <h3>
      Work that is submitted past the assignment due date will result in an automatic failure for the assignment. For work presented in critique, absence at the critique will result in an automatic failure for the assignment.
    </h3>


    <h2>CD App</h2>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <h3>
      It is mandatory for students in Core Studio Typography and Core Studio Interaction to attend all lectures. Attendance is recorded. Each missed lecture will be recorded as 1 tardy.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Lecture dates can be found on the CD App (https://cdparsons.glideapp.io/).
